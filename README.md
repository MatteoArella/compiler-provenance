# **Compiler provenance problems**

Compiler provenance problems group together all those problems related to
the identification of the compiler and of the optimization used for producing
program binary. Compiler provenance plays a key role on malware analysis
for reverse engineering and decompilation. The binary code should exhibit
properties specific to the process that produced it, but it is not at all clear
how to find such properties and map them to specific elements of that process.
Machine learning techniques provide a mechanism for constructing appropriate decision functions that can discriminate accurately between code generated by different toolchains.
